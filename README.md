Medieval take on the classic Rock Paper Scissors

# How It's Made:
### Tech used: 

**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

Getting started I did pseudo code to outline how I would tackle this project. From there, I began the layout of HTML, gave tags their ids/classes and began the JS portion. I tinkered a bit and with some persistence got it to work. Getting one weapon's function to become responsive made it easier to figure out how the rest would be constructed. Then I pulled everything together with the CSS.

# Lessons Learned:
First project using JavaScript and it was really fun to see HTML, CSS and JS work together to create a functioning game. Such as targeting the HTML from JavaScript and have a message display on the DOM. I learned how Math.random() and if/else if statements can be used together to generate a random integer that would effect the probability of the weapons choice of the user.
